# SSD Project Log Analysis

## How to Run

1. Give executable permissions to every script by running the following command:  
   ```bash
   chmod +x <script_name>
   ```

2. Run the log analysis through `driver.sh`:  
   ```bash
   ./driver.sh
   ```

3. To debug and run a specific script, use the following structure:  
   ```bash
   sudo ./test_auth.sh <date: yyyy-mm-dd> <start_time: hh:mm:ss> <end_time: hh:mm:ss>
   ```
   - replace test_auth.sh to desired  script.
